                    <span class="clor">lightning bolts</span>are a common phenomenon—about 100 strike Earth’s surface every single second—yet their power is extraordinary. Each bolt can contain up to one billion volts of electricity.

                <p>
                    A step-like series of
                    <span class="clor">negative charges, called a stepped leader,</span>works its way incrementally downward from the bottom of a storm cloud toward the Earth. Each of these segments is about 150 feet (46 meters) long. When the lowermost step comes within 150 feet (46 meters) of a positively charged object it is met by a climbing surge of positive electricity, called a streamer, which can rise up through a building, a tree, or even a person. The process forms a channel through which electricity is transferred as lightning.

            	I sometimes <span class="clor">stare at the sky</span> and wonder why we have made such a mess of things.  I wonder how we can tear up the seas and use up the trees all in the name of progress.  It is such a tragedy that we are damaging things so fast and they will soon be way beyond repair.
It is very sad to think future generations will not have the natural things to enjoy as we have had, and that they will be paupers when it comes to the offerings of the natural world.

Nature can set a sky aflame at sunset or magically transform a familiar landscape into a snow-white wonderland.  It can paint a rainbow in the sky, paint beautiful autumn colors on trees, or paint a clump of daffodils in the grass with glow of soft sunlight.
